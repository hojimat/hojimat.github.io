The paper explores the intersection between modularity and conformity in organizational contexts using agent-based model of organizations as complex systems. The results demonstrate that a concentration of interdependent tasks within fewer departments can boost overall performance. Conformity decreases performance in all organizational structures except for cases when the departments work on highly similar tasks. This decline in performance can also explain why functional organizational structures are still being used in practice even though they are less modular than divisional structures - they feature lower levels of conformity and, thus, face smaller decline. If departments are highly coupled, the performance can surprisingly be improved as complexity within departments increases.
